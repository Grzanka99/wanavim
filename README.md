# This is my preffered Neovim configuration

This config ~~is~~ was strongly inspired by
[LunarVim](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli/LunarVim),

But now LunarVim is much more mature and this config it's still on very very
early stage and more personal :D

Requirements:

- NodeJS
- Python3
- Neovim

Example installation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Grzanka99/wanavim $HOME/.config/nvim
```

## ! REMEMBER TO BACKUP YOUR OLD CONFIG !

### Enjoy ;)
