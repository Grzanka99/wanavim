# This is my preffered Neovim configuration

This config is strongly inspired by [LunarVim](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli/LunarVim), but has other file structure, and will be more personal, i guess. We'll see.

Requirements:

- NodeJS
- Python3
- Neovim

Recommended for gui: [Goneovim](https://github.com/akiyosi/goneovim)

Example installation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Grzanka99/wanavim $HOME/.config/nvim
```

## ! REMEMBER TO BACKUP YOUR OLD CONFIG !

### Enjoy ;)
